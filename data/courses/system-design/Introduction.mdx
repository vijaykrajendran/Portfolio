## Definition and Purpose of Databases

**Database:** A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is managed by a Database Management System (DBMS).

**Purpose of Databases:** Databases are used to store, retrieve, and manage data efficiently. They provide a systematic way to create, retrieve, update, and manage data, supporting various business operations and applications.

## Types of Databases

- **Relational Databases:** Mysql, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server
- **Non-Relational Databases:** MongoDB (document-based), Redis (key-value store), Cassandra (wide-column store), Neo4j (graph database)

##Explanation

- **Relational Databases:** These databases use a structure that allows us to identify and access data in relation to another piece of data in the database. They are based on the relational model, which organizes data into tables (or relations) of rows and columns.
    - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server
    - Characteristics: Tables with rows and columns, schema-based, supports SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and maintaining the database.

- **Non-Relational Databases:** Also known as NoSQL databases, they do not use the tabular schema of rows and columns found in relational databases. Instead, they might use documents, key-value pairs, wide-columns, or graphs to store data.
    - Examples: MongoDB (document-based), Redis (key-value store), Cassandra (wide-column store), Neo4j (graph database)
    - Characteristics: Flexible schema, scalable horizontally, designed for specific data models and access patterns.
