## Key Concepts: Tables, Rows, Columns

**Tables:** In a relational database, a table is a collection of related data entries consisting of columns and rows. Each table has a unique name.
    - **Example:** A table called Employees with columns EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, and Department.

**Rows:** Also known as records or tuples, rows represent a single, implicitly structured data item in a table.
    - **Example:** A row in the Employees table might be 1, John, Doe, HR.

**Columns:** Also known as attributes or fields, columns represent the structure of the table, where each column contains all the information of a single type (or attribute).
    - **Example:** The FirstName column in the Employees table contains all employees' first names.

## Primary Keys and Foreign Keys

**Primary Key:** A primary key is a column, or a set of columns, that uniquely identifies each row in a table. The primary key must contain unique values and cannot contain null values.

    - **Example:** EmployeeID in the Employees table could be a primary key.

**Foreign Key:** A foreign key is a column, or a set of columns, that creates a link between two tables. It refers to the primary key of another table, ensuring referential integrity of the data.

    - **Example:** If there is a Departments table with DepartmentID as the primary key, the Employees table can have a DepartmentID column as a foreign key referencing Departments(DepartmentID).
