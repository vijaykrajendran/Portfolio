NGINX is a high-performance web server and reverse proxy widely adopted in modern DevOps and production ecosystems. It is known for its event-driven, non-blocking architecture that allows it to handle thousands of concurrent connections with minimal resource usage.

## Why Do DevOps Engineers Use NGINX?

DevOps teams rely on NGINX because it can serve as:

- A high-performance **web server**  
- A **reverse proxy** for backend services  
- A **load balancer** that distributes traffic  
- An **SSL/TLS terminator**  
- A **static file server**  
- A **security layer** protecting APIs  
- A critical component in **Docker & Kubernetes** deployments  

NGINX sits at the edge of most infrastructures, acting as a central traffic manager.

## Real-World Usage

Some well-known companies that use NGINX in production include:

- Netflix  
- Airbnb  
- GitHub  
- Dropbox  
- Kubernetes (NGINX powers many Ingress controllers)

NGINX is popular for its stability, speed, and lightweight footprint.

## Visual Overview

Client → **NGINX** → Upstream / Backend Servers

NGINX receives client requests, processes them efficiently, and forwards them to the appropriate backend service.
