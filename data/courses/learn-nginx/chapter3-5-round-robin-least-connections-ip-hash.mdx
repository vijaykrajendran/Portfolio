# Load Balancing Methods Explained

## Round Robin Detailed

Request distribution: S1 → S2 → S3 → S1 → ...

- Simple and fair
- Default behavior
- Good for stateless apps

**Use when:** All servers are equal

## Least Connections Detailed

Always sends to server with fewest connections:

- Ideal for long connections
- Adapts to unequal server capacity
- Better than round-robin for WebSockets

**Use when:** Connection duration varies

## IP Hash Detailed

Same IP → Same server always

- Sticky sessions
- No session storage needed
- Problem: Server down = session loss

**Use when:** Sessions must stick to server

## Comparison Table

| Method | Session Sticky | Fair Distribution | Long Connections |
|--------|---|---|---|
| Round Robin | No | Yes | No |
| Least Conn | No | Yes | Yes |
| IP Hash | Yes | No | So-so |

Choose wisely!
