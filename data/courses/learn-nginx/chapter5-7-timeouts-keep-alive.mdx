# Timeouts and Keep-Alive

## Keep-Alive Settings

```nginx
http {
    keepalive_timeout 65;
    keepalive_requests 100;
}
```

- `keepalive_timeout` - How long to keep idle connections
- `keepalive_requests` - Max requests per connection

## Timeout Settings

```nginx
http {
    client_body_timeout 12;
    client_header_timeout 12;
    send_timeout 10;
}
```

- `client_body_timeout` - Time to send body
- `client_header_timeout` - Time for headers
- `send_timeout` - Time to send response

## Proxy Timeouts

```nginx
location / {
    proxy_connect_timeout 60s;
    proxy_send_timeout 60s;
    proxy_read_timeout 60s;
}
```

Optimized connections!
