# Load Balancing Algorithms

## Round Robin (Default)

Requests are distributed equally among all servers:

```nginx
upstream backend {
    server s1:8080;
    server s2:8080;
    server s3:8080;
}
```

Flow: S1 → S2 → S3 → S1 → S2 → ...

**Best for:** Servers with equal capacity

## Least Connections

Route to the server with fewest active connections:

```nginx
upstream backend {
    least_conn;
    server s1:8080;
    server s2:8080;
}
```

**Best for:** Long-lived connections (WebSocket, SSH)

## IP Hash

Same client IP always routes to same server:

```nginx
upstream backend {
    ip_hash;
    server s1:8080;
    server s2:8080;
}
```

**Best for:** Session persistence without shared storage

## Hash on Variable

Hash based on any Nginx variable:

```nginx
upstream backend {
    hash $cookie_userid;
    server s1:8080;
    server s2:8080;
}
```
