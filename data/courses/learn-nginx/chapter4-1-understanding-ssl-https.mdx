# Understanding SSL and HTTPS

## What is SSL/TLS?

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are encryption protocols for secure communications.

Modern standard is **TLS 1.2** and **TLS 1.3**.

## Why HTTPS?

- **Encryption** - Data encrypted in transit
- **Authentication** - Verify server identity
- **Integrity** - Detect tampering
- **SEO** - Google ranks HTTPS higher
- **Trust** - Users trust encrypted sites
- **Modern features** - Many features require HTTPS

## Certificate Types

| Type | Cost | Validation | Use Case |
|------|------|-----------|----------|
| Self-signed | Free | None | Testing only |
| DV | Cheap | Domain | Most sites |
| OV | \$\$ | Organization | Business |
| EV | \$\$\$ | Extended | Banks |

## TLS Versions

- **TLS 1.0** ❌ Deprecated
- **TLS 1.1** ❌ Deprecated
- **TLS 1.2** ✅ Use minimum
- **TLS 1.3** ✅ Best choice

Secure by default!
