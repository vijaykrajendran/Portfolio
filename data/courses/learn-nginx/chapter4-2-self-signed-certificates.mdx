# Self-Signed Certificates

## Generate Certificate

```bash
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 \
  -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout /etc/nginx/ssl/selfsigned.key \
  -out /etc/nginx/ssl/selfsigned.crt
```

Answer the prompts:
- Country
- State
- City
- Organization
- Common Name (your domain)

## Use in Nginx

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name example.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/selfsigned.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/selfsigned.key;
}
```

## HTTP to HTTPS Redirect

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
```

## Important Note

Self-signed certificates:
- ✅ Free
- ✅ Good for testing
- ❌ Browsers show warnings
- ❌ Not for production

Good for testing!
