# SSL/TLS Termination

## What is SSL Termination?

SSL termination means Nginx handles HTTPS and communicates with backends over HTTP.

```
Client (HTTPS)
    ↓
Nginx (decrypts here)
    ↓
Backend (HTTP)
```

## Why Terminate SSL?

- **Reduce backend CPU** - Encryption is expensive
- **Centralized certs** - One place to manage
- **Simpler backend** - Backend doesn't need SSL
- **Better performance** - Nginx optimized for SSL

## Configuration

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name example.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        # Backend talks HTTP only
        proxy_pass http://backend:3000;

        # Tell backend it's HTTPS
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

## Backend Detection

Your backend can detect original protocol:

```javascript
// Node.js example
const protocol = req.headers['x-forwarded-proto'];
if (protocol === 'https') {
  // Was HTTPS
}
```

Smart architecture!
