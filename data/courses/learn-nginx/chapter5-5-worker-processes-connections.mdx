# Worker Processes and Connections

## Worker Processes

```nginx
worker_processes auto;
```

Sets number of workers equal to CPU cores. Let Nginx detect!

## Worker Connections

```nginx
events {
    worker_connections 1024;
}
```

Maximum connections per worker.

Calculation:
- Max connections = worker_processes × worker_connections
- With 4 cores, 1024 connections = 4,096 max connections

## Tuning

```nginx
worker_processes auto;

events {
    worker_connections 2048;
    use epoll;  # Linux only
}
```

Maximum performance!
