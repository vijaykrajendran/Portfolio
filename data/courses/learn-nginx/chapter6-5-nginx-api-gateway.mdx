# Nginx as an API Gateway

## Route to Microservices

```nginx
upstream auth_service {
    server auth:3000;
}

upstream user_service {
    server users:3001;
}

upstream product_service {
    server products:3002;
}

server {
    location /auth {
        proxy_pass http://auth_service;
    }

    location /users {
        proxy_pass http://user_service;
    }

    location /products {
